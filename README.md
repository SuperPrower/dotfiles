### This is my dotfiles.
I mostly borrowed thing from other places and made them like I like.

### About it:

WM: i3 (previously OpenBox with slightly adjusted Leaves theme (taken from [/u/Eti_f's](https://github.com/eti0/dots/tree/master/.themes/leaves/openbox-3), big thanks to him!)), with colors taken from OpenBox theme

Panels: Polybar (also tint2 previously)

Launcher: Rofi with blor.theme (check rofi website)

Lockscreen: i3lock-color

Terminal/Panels font: Terminus

Terminal Colors: base16 Tomorrow Night

Vim Colors: base16 Tomorrow Night, slightly adjusted to get rid of awful highlights 

### Screenshots:

I really got tired of flat cold colors of Arc-Dark back in Xubuntu, so I decided to went with something warm and colorful. This is what I came up with.

About Polybar theme:
It uses underlines to indicate things you will be interested. So, if there is a Wi-Fi or LAN connection, it will highlight those. It will highlight battery if it is discharging or finished charging, and sound if there is any.

Polybar is wonderful, only shame is that it doesn't have taskbar (but now when I use i3, it's not a real shame, but polybar still needs some polish and bugfixes)
